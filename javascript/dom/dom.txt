//-------------Selecting dom elements------------

1): You can select elements by drilling into elements

You have to know the DOM structure and if it changes, your 
code needs to change as well.
It is a hard and clumsier way to accessing the elements.

2)Query elements
You can select elements without learning the exact
DOM strucuture and hence no exact DOM structure knowledge
is required


DOM not only stores the html elements but also
stores the content inside the html tags, and that
content is called childnodes and it can also be accessed
using childnodes

--------Most commonly used built-in methods for 
--------selecting/querying HTML elements via javascript--
1) document.getElementById("id");
-->It selects a HTML element by  its ID(selects only one
element, since IDs should be unique)

2) document.querySelector("some-css selector");

-->Selects the first matching(!) HTML element 
that is met/selected by the provided CSS selector;

-->The CSS selector can basically be any kind of valid CSS selector
(e.g. ID selector  tag type selector, class selector,
class selector, combined selectors etc.)

3) document.querySelectorAll("some css selector");

--> Selects ALL matching HTML elements that are met/
selected by the provided css selector.

4) document.getElementByClassName("some class");
5)document.getElementByTagName("some tag");
