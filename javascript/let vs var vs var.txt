Points to note:-
-----Always use let while declaring variables 
-----Don't use var unless you are working on old javascript code.

1) var is globally scoped while let and const are locally
scoped
2) var can be updated and re-declared within its scope.
3) let can be updated but not be redeclared.
4) cons can neither be updated nor redeclared.
For ex:-
const b=10;
/*
value of a constant variable cannot be
changed after it is declared
*/ 
5) const must be initialised during declaration unlike
let and var.
For ex:-
const a;//it will show error 
You have to initialise it while declaring.
For ex:- const a=10; //This is correct
6) var variables are initialised with undefined whereas
let and const variables are not initialised.
